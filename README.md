# TinePhotoShop
* A computer vision class project from SJTU SE.
* Full of ui bugs and potential algorithm bugs.
* Implement all the image processing functions by myself (and some codes on website) instead of invoking the functions from library. 
  (OpenCV is just used as loading and saving images & some basic image processing support)
* All the functions work correctly based on correct input (& sequence).
* Just serve as a backup for myself now.

## Tools
Developed by vs2017, opencv 3.3.0 and qt (the open source version).


## Functions
This will not be finished until anyone interests besides me and my friends.


## Get Help
Leave an issue and I will reply when I see it. More info will be offered if this project is helpful.
