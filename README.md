# TinePhotoShop
* A computer vision class project from SJTU SE.
* Implement all the image processing functions by myself (and some codes on website) instead of invoking the functions from library. 
  (OpenCV is just used as loading and saving images & some basic image processing support)
* All the functions work correctly based on correct input (& sequence).
* Just serve as a backup for myself now.

## Tools
Developed by vs2017, opencv 3.3.0 and qt (the open source version).


## Functions
### Color Image Processing
- Convert into gray image
- Separation of three channels
- Adjust HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) 
- Adjust color gradation

### Binarization
- Single / Double thresholds
- Otus algorithm

### Algebra and Geometry Operations
- Add, subtract, multiply, clip
- Rotate and zoom (Nearest Neighbor Interpolation & Bilinear Interpolation)

### Contrast Adjustion
- Linear gray level transformation & piecewise linear gray level transformation
- Nonlinear gray level transformation: exponential & logarithmic
- Gradation histogram
- Histogram equalization

### Smoothing Filter 
- Convolution kernel can be set by user
- Mean, median and Gauss filter

### Edge Detection
- Sobel, Laplace and Canny Algorithm

binary morphological reconstruction

### Gray Morphology
- Erosion, dilation, open, close, morphological reconstruction, watershed algorithm
